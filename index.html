        DUNNO WHY BUT I WANT TO MAKE A PROMISE TO YOU...
         <br>Today, I want to make you a promise - a promise to stand by your side through thick and thin, 
         to support you in your dreams and aspirations, and to cherish every moment we share together.

        I promise to be your rock, your confidant, and your best friend. I promise to listen to you, 
        to understand you, and to love you unconditionally. I promise to laugh with you in times of joy
         and hold you close in times of sorrow. I promise to respect you, to honor you, and to always be
          honest with you.
        
        But above all, I promise to love you fiercely and passionately, now and for all eternity. 
        You are my light, my love, and my everything, and I vow to spend the rest of my days making you happy.
